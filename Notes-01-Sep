=========================================

# git status

# git add <filename> <filename2>

or

git add --all

or

git add .

or

git add *.java *.php

# git status

# git commit -m "adding file index1.html"

Commit all the changes/files in the stagging area

If we want to Choose a file to be commited

git commit -m "adding file index1.html" <filename>

================================================

Modify exisitng files and add those changes to local repo
====================================================

Take a file which is in local repo

# git ls-files

# vim index1.html

add any data & save the file

# git status

status of file is modified

To add all the modification and commit them to local repo

# git commit -a -m "added modifications"

=================================================
1. Check the log for commit history

# git log

in this HEAD it is an object in git which represents the latest/recent commit id

# git log --oneline

Check commit history of every commit in a single line

# git show <commid id>
Shows what happened in that commit.

See commits of a particular file:

 git log --graph --all -- index1.html

==============================================================

Delete a file form LR and WD
===================================================================
# git rm index1.html

==> this command deletes file from WD and LR
As we have deleted somethign on LR/made chnage on LR , we need to track that. So commit the deletion

# git commit -m "deleted file"

# git ls-files
# ls
File will not be in localrepo and WD

========================================================

Revert command in GIT
=========================================================
> This command is applicable only to commit id
> using this command we cna revert the chnages of the commit to its previous state
> but when a revert command is executed, it is chnage something on the LR, so there needs to be a commit again
> When revert command is executed, immediatly a nano editor where user will eneter a message why we are reverting
> save the file. Revert will be complete and a new commit id will be generated

# git revert <deletioncommitid>
